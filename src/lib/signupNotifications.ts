/**
 * Fires the moment a policy is registered, by whatever route -- an agent in
 * the office, or a self-service checkout on the public site.
 *
 * Both the new client and the Enpassent office are told immediately: the
 * client gets confirmation of what was registered, and the office gets a
 * heads-up they can act on without opening the system.
 *
 * Enpassent is the broker the client actually deals with -- it places
 * business with almost every insurer in Zimbabwe, Motions included -- so
 * every client-facing message here speaks as Enpassent. Which insurer ends
 * up carrying the risk is a separate fact, shown on the policy itself, never
 * baked into the greeting.
 *
 * Everything here is best-effort and never rethrows. A registration that
 * succeeded must not appear to fail because a text message or a mailbox was
 * temporarily unreachable.
