/**
 * Which insurer a client is placed with, and what happens when nobody picks.
 *
 * Enpassent is a broker: it places business with almost every insurer in
 * Zimbabwe, so the insurer is a real choice and the field is deliberately
 * optional -- a signup must never be blocked because the question was not
 * answered yet.
 *
 * When it is left blank the client is provisionally placed with the house
 * insurer, Motions, so the record has somewhere to sit and staff have
 * something to work from. That assignment is PROVISIONAL and is recorded as
 * such. Two rules follow from that word, and both matter:
 *
 *  1. It applies to the client record only, never to a policy. Registering a
 *     client puts no cover in place (see notifyClientRegistered), so nothing
 *     about anyone's risk has been decided and there is nothing to disclose.
 *     A policy is different: the insurer on it is the party that pays the
 *     claim, so it stays whatever was explicitly chosen and is never
 *     back-filled from a provisional assignment.
 *  2. It is never presented as a choice the client made. Staff see the flag
 *     -- it is their queue of people still to be asked -- and it is stored
 *     honestly rather than being made to look deliberate.
